1. What is DOM?
Ans: If we closely observed the HTML Document, we will find that it is structured as 
Object in JavaScript. This structured representation is called Document Object Model.
And Since it is similar to Object. We can easily create, access and manipulate 
through JavaScript. We can easily interact in the webpage using DOM.

If we closely observe the HTML document, we will find that it is structured as an object in JavaScript. This structured representation is called the Document Object Model (DOM). Since it is similar to a JavaScript object, we can easily create, access, and manipulate HTML elements through JavaScript. The DOM allows us to interact with and dynamically modify a webpage's content, structure, and style.


To select elements from the DOM in JavaScript, we can use various methods. Some 
of those are: getElementById(), getElementsByClassName(), getElementsByTagName(),
querySelector(), querySelectorAll() etc.

When we want to handle higher level element we have use a technique using bubble
effect in DOM. This technique is called event delegation in the context of DOM.
It is very useful when we want to dynamically add child from parent. 



When we want to handle events on a higher-level element, we can use a technique called event delegation in the context of the DOM. This technique leverages the event bubbling effect, where an event on a child element propagates up to its parent elements.

Event delegation is particularly useful when we need to handle events for child elements that are dynamically added by the parent. Instead of adding event listeners to each child element, we add one listener to the parent and manage the event handling as the event bubbles up.

How do you manipulates an element's attributes and styles using the
          DOM?

We can manipulate an element's attributes and styles in bunch of different methods.
Some of those are: getAttribute(), setAttribute(), removeAttribute(), and setting value of 
propery using elemnt.style.respective-style.

When I input 500abcd as donation, It deducts 500 from balance and add with 
respective fund. How can I prevent this. Can I use input field as "number".
Other than everything is validated. Or it is really needed. video instruction
(at 6.18 min) says only to validate string and negative number.
